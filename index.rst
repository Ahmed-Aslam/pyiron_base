Welcome to the official documentation of the pyiron package! pyiron is a Python based IDE for computational materials
design.


============
Introduction
============

What is pyiron?
===============

pyiron is a free and open-source library developed, tested and maintained by computational physicists and materials scientists at the department of
`Computational Materials Design <https://www.mpie.de/CM>`_  at the Max-Planck-Institut für Eisenforschung GmbH, Düsseldorf
and the department of `Atomistic Modelling and Simulation <http://www.icams.de/content/departments/atomistic-modelling-and-simulation/>`_
at the  Ruhr-Universität Bochum, Germany. pyiron offers a convenient way to automate workflows in atomistic simulations so that
users can concentrate on the science rather than the technical details of their simulations.

User friendliness
=================

pyiron is designed in the 'pythonic' way of making extensive use of object oriented programming, functional programming
and intuitive naming conventions to make things easier for users.
