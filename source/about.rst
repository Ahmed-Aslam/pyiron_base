pyiron is the integrated development environment for computational materials science. It connects among other things:

* Atomic structure objects – compatible to the `Atomic Simulation Environment (ASE) <https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase/>`_.

* Atomistic simulation codes – like `LAMMPS <http://lammps.sandia.gov>`_ and `VASP <https://www.vasp.at>`_.

* Feedback Loops – to construct dynamic simulation life cycles.

* Hierarchical data management – interfacing with storage resources like SQL and `HDF5 <https://support.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/>`_.

* Integrated visualization – based on the `NGLview <https://github.com/arose/nglview>`_.

* Interactive simulation protocols - based on `Jupyter notebooks <http://jupyter.org>`_.

* Object oriented job management – for scaling simulation protocols.

pyiron was initially developed in the `Computational Materials Design department <https://www.mpie.de/CM>`_ of `Joerg Neugebauer <https://www.mpie.de/person/43010/2763386>`_ at the `Max Planck Insitut für Eisenforschung (Max Planck Insitute for iron research) <https://www.mpie.de/2281/en>`_ as a framework for ab initio thermo dynamics. In collaboration with the `Interdisciplinary Centre for Advanced Materials Simulation (ICAMS) <http://www.icams.de>`_ the framework was recently extended for high throughput applications resulting in the opensource release of the pyiron.
